Deep Learning
----------------

1. Pre-Training: CNN-based AutoEncoder for denoising MNIST images
2. Transfer Learning: on EfficientNet for Image classification to identify images with people
3. Unsepervised pre-training: Weather Forecasting on WeatherNet using LSTM
4. Zero-shot prediction: Fake image detection on FakeNet using GAN: without using caption
5. Ensemble modeling: Count signals and vehivles on CarNet
